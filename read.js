/* READ — one post of the coverage, read here instead of on Konami's blog.

   Its own page, and its own tab, on purpose. The coverage list is a dense
   index of a few hundred headlines and an article opened inside it buries the
   next twenty; a post that has a page has a link somebody can send, and a back
   button that goes back to the list rather than to the middle of it.

   Three files, all of them small or already wanted: the manifest for the
   event's name and who covered it, the event's posts.json for this post's
   headline and kind, and the event's articles.json for the words. The rounds
   -- half a megabyte of pairings -- are never fetched: nothing here is about
   a round.

   The blog's markup is not what arrives. The scraper stored runs of text and
   which of them are emphasised, and blocksHtml in common.js turns those into
   elements, escaping every character of it. */
